# Simple Storage

### What is Simple Storage
Simple Storage is a basic introduction to smart contracts, the contract is tested on `Rinkeby` testnet
and is fully functional with both `js` and `ts`.

### What it does
This contract is the very basic introduction to the smart contracts and only can be used to store using `store()` and number `uint256` and the retrieve it back using `retrieve()`. There is a declaration of a new object type `People` with a name and favourite number as the only two parameters.
A `People` object can be added using `addPerson()` which takes the `name` and `favNum`.
